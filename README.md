## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Frontend → React, TailwindCSS
- Backend → FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- Database → SQLite (default, can be swapped with PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- AI Layer → Sarvam AI API (summarization)
- PDF Reports → ReportLab

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayur-143/AI-Doc-Insight-Tool.git
cd AI-Doc-Insight-Tool
```
### 2️⃣ Backend Setup (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
cd ../
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a .env file inside the backend/ folder:
```bash
SARVAM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
or set env key in the command prompt(PowerShell)
```bash
$env:SARVAM_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
Run Backend (from root directory): 
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
Backend will run at → http://127.0.0.1:8000
### Database
- By default, SQLite is used. The DB file is automatically created on first run.
- Can be swapped with PostgreSQL/MySQL by updating database.py.

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup (React + Tailwind)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Frontend will run at → http://localhost:3000

## 🖼 Sample Workflow
- Upload a resume PDF.
- Backend extracts text → calls Sarvam AI API for summarization.
- Insights are stored in the database.
- Frontend displays AI-generated insights.
- User can search, filter, and download the insights report (PDF).
